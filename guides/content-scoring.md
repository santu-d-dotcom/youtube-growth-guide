## Introduction

Wouldn't it be powerful to know how your video will perform before you publish it? Content scoring makes that possible by evaluating your content across multiple dimensions and predicting performance probability.

**What is Content Scoring?**

Content scoring is a systematic evaluation framework that assesses your video's potential performance before publishing. It examines:
- Content quality and value
- Optimization elements
- Audience alignment
- Competitive positioning
- Performance indicators

Platforms like [Creator Unlock](https://creatorunlock.com?fpr=chris95) use AI to automate content scoring, but understanding manual scoring makes you a better creator.

- **Predict performance** - Estimate success probability
- **Identify weaknesses** - Find optimization opportunities
- **Improve before publishing** - Fix issues early
- **Prioritize content** - Focus on high-scoring videos
- **Increase success rate** - Systematically improve quality

**Impact of Scoring:**
